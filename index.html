    <div class="letter">
      <p>The challenge of having zero or poor credit is one that holds 54 million people in the US back from reaching their full potential. This year, at Mission Asset Fund, we’ve taken a number of steps to open more doors, create new opportunities and build a brighter, better future for our members. You could say we’re “leveling up.”</p>
      <p>From passing groundbreaking legislation with SB 896 and expanding our national network of partners to launching our new Social Loan platform and moving to a new office, 2014 has been a big year for us. Since this is our first annual report, we also want to share with you what we’ve accomplished since MAF began in 2007. We’re excited to show how far we’ve come in scaling Lending Circles to help more individuals and communities reach their various goals and be on a path towards financial stability. With so much success to celebrate, we want to say thank you! Because of your support, more hardworking families are leveling up their lives through credit-building. Be on the look out for more exciting developments in the next year! </p>

            <h2>Expanding Partnerships</h2>
            <p>Demand for credit building products is all over the country, so 
               we hit the road to 5 cities this year to recruit new partners. 
               This year, we’ve added 7 new organizations to our network of 
               Lending Circles providers. These partnerships make it easier for 
               nonprofits to offer low-cost credit-building programs so their 
               clients get an effective, hands-on experience that transforms 
               their economic opportunity.</p>

            <h2>Moving To A New Office</h2>
            <p>We moved from our home of 3 years on Valencia St to a new 
               building on Mission St in October 2014. We loved our old office 
               but the new space gives us the opportunity to serve more of our 
               members with larger meeting rooms and better use of 
               technology.</p>

            <h2>Launching Our Social Loan Platform</h2>
            <p>We developed a one-of-a-kind Social Loan platform that weaves 
               mobile‐friendly loan applications with automated credit 
               reporting, loan payment servicing, and Salesforce’s Communities. 
               This was a huge feat that will make it easier for us to manage 
               Lending Circles, for people to find and join a Lending Circle and
               for nonprofits to become providers.</p>

            <p>A redesign of our website and logo have given us a new look. The

               variety of communities we serve. The new pages of our website are

            <p>In addition to reaching a $2 million loan volume and 3,000 
               participants nationwide, we’ve launched two new programs: 
               Security Deposit Loan and Lending Circles for Home Ownership, 
               which will make it easier for our members to secure safe and 
               affordable housing. We are excited about the future of creating 
               meaningful products with the flexibility of our new platform.</p>

            <h2>Passing SB 896</h2>
            <p>In an effort to make large-scale change, MAF worked hard to 
               create and pass SB 896 legislation that will enable more 
               nonprofits in California to facilitate credit-building loans. 
               When Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law in August 2014, MAF 
               celebrated an exciting chapter in our organization’s history and 
               that of the asset-building field.</p>

      <p>We’re excited to bring the power of credit building to new communities across the U.S. In 2015, we’ll deepen and expand our reach throughout the SF Bay Area and across the country by partnering with community based nonprofits looking to improve outcomes for their clients and strengthen their financial empowerment programs with credit-building.</p>
       
      <h2>Target Key Markets</h2>
      <p>This, year we have our eyes set on California, New York, Texas, Illinois, Florida, and states in the Northwest that have vibrant and growing immigrant communities that are facing financial exclusion and are looking for a high-tech yet community-based solution that works. </p>
       
      <h2>Relevant and Accessible Programs</h2>
      <p>Millions of immigrant families now have the amazing opportunity to gain three-year protective status through Deferred Action, lifting the fog of fear and uncertainty in their lives. Deferred Action will unleash their economic potential with opportunities for better paying jobs and engage light of day. In 2015, we will offer new programs and services to make sure that hardworking low-income families have a chance at a better future and ability to access services to meet their financial needs.</p>
