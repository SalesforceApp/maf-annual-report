        </p><p class="letter">Our values are: Respect people for who they are, meet them where they are and build on what they have.</p>

            <p class="letter">
              The challenge of having zero or poor credit is one that holds 54 million people in the US back from reaching their full potential. This year, at Mission Asset Fund, we’ve taken a number of steps to open more doors, create new opportunities and build a brighter, better future for our members. You could say we’re “leveling up.”
            </p><p class="letter">
              From passing groundbreaking legislation with SB 896 and expanding our national network of partners to launching our new Social Loan platform and moving to a new office, 2014 has been a big year for us. Since this is our first annual report, we also want to share with you what we’ve accomplished since MAF began in 2007. We’re excited to show how far we’ve come in scaling Lending Circles to help more individuals and communities reach their various goals and be on a path towards financial stability.
              With so much success to celebrate, we want to say thank you! Because of your support, more hardworking families are leveling up their lives through credit-building. Be on the look out for more exciting developments in the next year! <br><br>

      <h2>Expanding Reach</h2>
      <p class="letter">We’re excited to bring the power of credit building to new communities across the U.S. In 2015, we’ll deepen and expand our reach throughout the SF Bay Area and across the country by partnering with community based nonprofits looking to improve outcomes for their clients and strengthen their financial empowerment programs with credit-building.</p>
       
      <h2>Target Key Markets</h2>
      <p class="letter">This, year we have our eyes set on California, New York, Texas, Illinois, Florida, and states in the Northwest that have vibrant and growing immigrant communities that are facing financial exclusion and are looking for a high-tech yet community-based solution that works. </p>
       
      <h2>Relevant and Accessible Programs</h2>
      <p class="letter">Millions of immigrant families now have the amazing opportunity to gain three-year protective status through Deferred Action, lifting the fog of fear and uncertainty in their lives. Deferred Action will unleash their economic potential with opportunities for better paying jobs and engage light of day. In 2015, we will offer new programs and services to make sure that hardworking low-income families have a chance at a better future and ability to access services to meet their financial needs.</p>
